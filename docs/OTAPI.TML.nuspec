        The Open Terraria API, known as OTAPI, is a low-level API for Terraria that rewrites and hooks into the official or modded binaries for others to use.

        OTAPI is primarily a server modification and is available as a cross platform package via NuGet.

        Version 3.0 is now a .NET9 library thanks to ModFramework being able to retarget the .NET4 vanilla assembly up to .NET9.
        This means that any mod you create can be written as a .NET9 module and later merged into the patched assembly thanks to MonoMod.

        Here is what is now possible:
         - Native Runtime hooks, just reference OTAPI.Runtime.dll and register to MonoMod events generated from the Terraria assembly.
         - Full .NET9 ecosystem and its performance improvements. No need for two targets such as Windows &amp; Mono anymore either.
         - A new optional internal module system via ModFramework to load precompiled dll's, .cs files or even top level classes.
         - A strong set of libraries with methods and extensions to help you build more mods.
         - Create 1 file MonoMod patches to rewrite or inject new meta data to the assembly.
